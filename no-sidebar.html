						<h2>8th grade graduation picture from Saint Charles Borromeo</h2>
						<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/8thgrade.jpg" alt="" /></a>
						<p>The picture you see is my class graduation picture. *th grade was the best year than the other years. The reason why because it was the last year with my best friends. My favorite teacher teached us the most interesting things. He also told us about himself. Learning from him was the best. His name is Mr. Poling or Peter Poling. Having his dad arounfd the school is fun because his dad was really smart and also he told us about the war and his background.</p>

								<h3>Mr.Poling</h3>
								<p>Mr. Poling is my favorite teacher than all time. This picture was taken by my sister and after graduation. He was the best 8th grade tecaher. My favorite memory of Mr. Poling is when my class dyed his hair black also his beard too.</p>

								<h3>Mr.Downs</h3>
								<p>Mr. Downs is my second favorite teacher. He taught me in 6th grade and he was awesome. Being his student was great because all the stories he told was funny also interesting. My favorite memory of Mr. Downs is when we had an argument about chesse burgers and ham burgers .</p>
