								<h3>Why do this website?</h3>
								<p>Doing a website about me is pretty cool because you can learn more about me, me before highschool, and my family. I like everything about me, I am a hat collector, everything I wear needs to be matching with a hat or my shoes. My sister thinks I am a narcissistic and maybe I agree. . </p>
