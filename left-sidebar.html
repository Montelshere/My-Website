								<p> The shirt I was wearing was a Teen Titans shirt and the hat I was wearing was a Robin hat. Both of those items was from not from my favorite store Hot Topic, but the store F.Y.E. Most of the pictures my sister takes of me is when I look away from the camera looking the view or looking at nothing. .</p>
								<p>Things about me is preety cool. I like to collect a lot of hats, but my dad has more hats than me, I like to match my clothing, I like to be lazy, taking pictures of views is like one of my hobbies, my hobbies are shopping, drawing, gaming, cooking with my mom, and fixing my car. No one knows the real me yet. Living in peace is my goal. My favorite colors is green, red, black, and purple. People known me as a loud and obnoxious person, but thats only around them. My favorite singers/rappers/bands are Eminem, Logic, Mac Miller. Hollywood Undead, Dr.Dre, Futuristic, and many more. I think I am a narcissis.</p>
